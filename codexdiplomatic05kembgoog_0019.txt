scearu is the general or public share, as folcriht is the
public law, (folces folcriht, No, ccxcv1,) folctoga the
public leader,—compounds in which folc is equivalent
to peo'd in such words as peo‘dcyning, peo‘dsceaoa, pefid-
loga. '

periodS, and its use as a test of authenticity, it should
have been mentioned, that in copies of more ancient
charterS, made at the close of the eleventh century,
