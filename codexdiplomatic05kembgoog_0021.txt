So many and various are >the difficulties which
stand in the way of a decisive judgment, that I
do not entertain the hope of having rarely fallen
into error, when investigating the authenticity of
my documentS. My leaning is generally rather
against than for any charter respecting which a
doubt has suggested itself to my mind; and it must,
therefore, be borne in mind that many have been
marked with an asterisk, not to express my beIIef
that they were absolute forgerieS, but merely to dc-
note that there were circumstances of suspicion. I
may have wronged them, and sincerely hope I have:
the publication of my Fasti Saxonici will, in a great

majority of cases, explain the grounds upon which I
have proceeded.

I have to apologize for one or two mistakes of
which I have been guilty in my first volume, and beg
to correct them here.

No. x1.—The copy of this charter in good MSS. of
William of Malmesbury is better than mine, and should
be used for correction of the text, particularly in the
proem, reading saeuientium sor semencz‘um.

No. LXX1x.—The quarta feria has been inadvert-
ently called Thursday, instead of Wednesday, in the
note. But the calculations were all made accurately,
and apply to Wednesday, November the 24th. At the
same time, the years ’751 and ’756 should have been
added to the number of those in which that day of the
month and week fell together.

No. cxx.-—This is more probably of the year 775.
