a right to demand, from a comparison of ccchxix. and
ccchxx, for the latter. The next ground of objec-

largitatem corroboraui.’

On this point the authenticity of more than twenty
charters dependS, in all of which this Bishop's name
is found ε and as the authority of Hickes is deservedly
very great, I have thought it worth while to dispose

would seem of greater weight than it deserved.

Some of the charters in this volume had either not
come to my hands at all, or had come in a mutilated
and imperfect state, when I wrote the Introduction to
the first volume. They supply corroboration of one
or two interesting pointS, which I there attempted to
establish. The most important of these is the nature
