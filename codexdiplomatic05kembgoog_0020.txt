, X INTRODUCTION.

the transcriber sometimes took the liberty of varying
the plain old form, to suit the fantastical fashion of his
own time3 and this must therefore be taken into ac-
count in any argument as to authenticity, resting upon
the subscriptions. An example of this practice may be
given from the archives of Christchurch, Canterbury.
In that collection are found two copies of a charter
bearing date October 12th‚ 803, and which will be
printed in my AppendiX. The document records a
very solemn act of the Archbishop of Canterbury and
the twelve Bishops of his province, and the earlier
copy may be an autograph: the later is probably of
the twelfth century, or very late in the eleventh. Now,
in the original, every one of the Bishops signs in these
very simple terms t

Ego N. talis ciuitatis episcopus signum crucis sub·-
scripsi. -

The modern copy, after giving the body of the in-
strument verbatim, proceeds in the following manner,
giving first the name of the prelate and his see:

Ego A. etc. signum sanctae crucis subscripsi.

Ego'B. — signaui.

Ego C. — signum sanctum impressi.
Ego D. —- signum inposui almum.
Ego E. — signum notaui.

Ego F. —- consignaui.

*Ego G. -——— signum crucis subscripsi.
Ego H. —- confirmaui.

Ego I. -- assensi.

Ego K. — consolidaui.

The remaining three names have the original ‘ sig-
num crucis subscripsi.’
