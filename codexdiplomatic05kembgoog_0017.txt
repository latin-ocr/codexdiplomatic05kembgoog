directly stigmatized as forgeries3 and that several,
which he had not seen, have been also recognized
by me, though liable to the same objections which
seemed to him decisive evidence against those he had
investigated. In justice to the reader, as well as to
myself, I will here state at once why I have come to
the conclusion I adopt. In· p. 6 of that admirable
work, the ‘Dissertatio EpistolariS,' Hickes gives as
egregia doli et imposturae exempla, two charters of
AEsselstan bearing date in his copies A.D. 670, and
N οε. cchXXI. and ccccxxm. in this collection. His
grounds of objection are threefold : first, from the use
of sigillum, which I have disposed of in the Introduc·-
tion to vol. 1. p. (313 next, from the glaring ana-
chronism in the date3 lastly, from the signature of
Bishop AEbelgar.

No doubt the date 670 is a very gross anachron-
ism3 but HickeS, who evidently had modern, i. e.
Normanno·Saxon copies only of these instrumentS,
seems not to have been willing to admit the possibility
of these having been made by a careless or ignorant
transcriber, to whom alone the error might be owing.
Such, however, was no doubt the case. No. GOCLXX,
a grant to the same church, is printed from a modern
copy, and contains precisely the same error in the
date3 but of this the original autograph or duplicate
now exists in the archives of the Dean and Chapter
of Canterbury, and here the anachronism vanisheS,
the charter bearing the true date, viz. A. D. 937. (N 0.
cchxlx.) I claim, then, for Nos, cccnxxl. and
cocnxxm. the same gentle construction which I have
